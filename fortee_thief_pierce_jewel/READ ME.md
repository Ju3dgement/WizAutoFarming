This Couch Potato bot farms the Ghultures in Mirage
requirements: wizwalker, wizsprinter

Uses a modified UWB (credit Major) and WizSprinter (credit SirOlaf)

set up configs according to your character's spells e.g. temp[epic] | lord[epic]
for more info about config set up see Major's examples on his github

To start go to caravan in Mirage and stand near the ghultures place a waypoint marker and run the cpbot.py file
it is recommended to start with full mana and potions (haven't fixed the fill up potions automatically)

Automatic refill potion not working atm (will fix later)
